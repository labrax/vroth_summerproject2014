COMPILE
	This program uses features of C++11 standard, which gcc4.7.2+ may have.
	Be sure to have build-essential package on Linux.
	This program uses pthreads.
	
	Use the Makefile to compile. (recommended: make -j <NUMBER_OF_CPUs>)
	
RUN
	Run the program as specified in it, or in the end of this section.

	This program will require 'sort' and 'uniq' programs, which will be executed as the preprocessing stage.
	
	You'll need a phenotypes file, or transactions file.
	The ontologies file (of class relationship) is optional. The format /.obo/ 1.2 is accepted.
	
	To show options, run as:
	./apriori -h
	
	---
	use format:
	-a	dont-append-ontologies: only use ontologies for semantic similarity
	-r	filter-results: DISABLED

	-h	help: will print this instruction of use
	-p	preprocessed: will not use 'sort -u' in the file before reading
	-v	verbose: will print some information of execution
	-d	debug: will print the sets information

	-f	transactions-file <file>: input file
	-o	ontologies-file <file>: input file

	-x	new-transactions-file <file>: create a new 'transactions' file using the rules

	-c	confidence <number 0 to 1>: confidence value - default 0.8
	-l	minsupport <number 0 to 1>: minimum support value - default 0.5
	-u	maxsupport <number 0 to 1>: maximum support value - default 1

	-R to enable rules-filtering
	-I to enable itemset-filtering
	-M <number> to limit the number of iterations

	-t	thread <optional: number of threads>: to use parallelization

	options can be guessed, if:
	the phenotypes file is .txt it doesn't need -f
	the ontologies file is .obo it doesn't need -o

	example of use: 
	./apriori -f mousephenotypes.txt -o mammalian_phenotype.obo -t=20
	./apriori mousephenotypes.txt mammalian_phenotype.obo -t -s 0.01 -c 0.3
