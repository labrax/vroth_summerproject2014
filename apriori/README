COMPILE
	This program uses features of C++11 standard, which gcc4.7.2+ may have.
	Be sure to have build-essential package on Linux.
	This program uses pthreads.
	
	Use the Makefile to compile. (recommended: make -j <NUMBER_OF_CPUs>)
	
RUN
	Run the program as specified in it.
	
	You'll need a phenotypes file, or transactions file.
	The ontologies file (of class relationship) is optional. The format /.obo/ 1.2 is accepted.
	
	To show options, run as:
	./apriori -h
	
	---
	use format:
	-f <file>	 to select the phenotypes file
	-o <file>	 to select and use ontologies file
	-p		 to indicate the phenotypes file is sorted with no duplicates
	-s <support>	 to select the support (default 0.5)
	-c <confidence>	 to select the confidence (default 0.8)
	-t <number>	 to select threads (number is optional)
	-v		 enable verbose

	support and confidence must be in range 0 to 1

	options can be guessed, if:
	the phenotypes file is .txt it doesn't need -f
	the ontologies file is .obo it doesn't need -o

	example of use: 
	./apriori -f mousephenotypes.txt -o mammalian_phenotype.obo -t=20
	./apriori mousephenotypes.txt mammalian_phenotype.obo -t -s 0.01 -c 0.3
